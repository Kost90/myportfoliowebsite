Front end builded with react.js, for saving state I used useReducer and useContext.
All forms created with react-hook-form, value of forms valider with yup.
When user registreted password is hashing on backend and when user login created jwt token on backend.
Buttons and inputs created with Material UI, and used some animation with framer-motion.

Resume generated by fetching post promises to OpenAI API and get from there responses.

Backend:

Backend created with express.js, PostgresSQL, Sequelize, using hashing password and created jwt token when user is login.
All data saveg in Postgres database.
